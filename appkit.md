​
Custom Installation
If you are setting up your React app, please do not use npx create-react-app, as it has been deprecated. Using it may cause dependency issues. Instead, please use Vite to create your React app. You can set it up by running npm create vite@latest.

Implementation
​
AppKitProvider Component
AppKit now provides an AppKitProvider React component for easy integration in React applications. This component wraps your app and provides the AppKit context to all child components.

Copy
import { AppKitProvider } from '@reown/appkit/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <AppKitProvider
      projectId="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      networks={[
        /* Your Networks */
      ]}
    >
      {/* Your App */}
    </AppKitProvider>
  )
}

wagmi Example
Check the React wagmi example
For a quick integration, you can use the createAppKit function with a unified configuration. This automatically applies the predefined configurations for different adapters like Wagmi, Ethers, or Solana, so you no longer need to manually configure each one individually. Simply pass the common parameters such as projectId, chains, metadata, etc., and the function will handle the adapter-specific configurations under the hood.
This includes WalletConnect, Coinbase and Injected connectors, and the Blockchain API as a transport
On top of your app set up the following configuration, making sure that all functions are called outside any React component to avoid unwanted rerenders.

Copy
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'

import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { arbitrum, mainnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiAdapter } from '@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi'

// 0. Setup queryClient
const queryClient = new QueryClient()

// 1. Get projectId from https://dashboard.reown.com
const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'

// 2. Create a metadata object - optional
const metadata = {
  name: 'AppKit',
  description: 'AppKit Example',
  url: 'https://example.com', // origin must match your domain & subdomain
  icons: ['https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179229932']
}

// 3. Set the networks
const networks = [mainnet, arbitrum]

// 4. Create Wagmi Adapter
const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({
  networks,
  projectId,
  ssr: true
})

// 5. Create modal
createAppKit({
  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],
  networks,
  projectId,
  metadata,
  features: {
    analytics: true // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration
  }
})

export function AppKitProvider({ children }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
​
Importing networks
Reown AppKit use Viem networks under the hood, which provide a wide variety of networks for EVM chains. You can find all the networks supported by Viem within the @reown/appkit/networks path.

Copy
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit'
import { mainnet, arbitrum, base, scroll, polygon } from '@reown/appkit/networks'

To open AppKit you can use our web component or build your own button with AppKit hooks. In this example we are going to use the <appkit-button> component.
Web components are global html elements that don’t require importing.

Copy
export default function ConnectButton() {
  return <appkit-button />
}

Smart Contract Interaction
Wagmi
Ethers
Solana
Wagmi hooks can help us interact with wallets and smart contracts:

Copy
import { useReadContract } from "wagmi";
import { USDTAbi } from "../abi/USDTAbi";

const USDTAddress = "0x...";

function App() {
  const result = useReadContract({
    abi: USDTAbi,
    address: USDTAddress,
    functionName: "totalSupply",
  });
}
